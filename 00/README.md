#2-minute plan/scope: 
Scrape the basic assets from the site. 
Format HTML loosely with respect to HTML5 w3schools.com

##Focus:
Clean and simple

##Out of Scope:
More-than-boilerplate CSS styling
Templating HTML (I.e. DRY - don't repeat yourself... I will!)


#Retrospective
* Just did index.html & about.html - home and another page. Don't see the point in completing other pages now because the pattern will likely change too much during the iterations. 

## TODO: 
* Template out the header & footer somehow
* Make background images span header div properly
* Size logo
* Center Header Headings Text
* Try a carousel of some type
* Finish HTML for other pages.
